# `mapbox-gl-esri-feature-layers`

Load esri feature layers in mapbox-gl. This is a pared down version of [@seasketch/mapbox-gl-esri-sources](https://github.com/seasketch/mapbox-gl-esri-sources) and is intended to be a replacement. The older version included classes like ArcGISVectorSource & ArcGISDynamicMapService which could be used to load data and keep the map up to date. This turned out not to be useful in SeaSketch Next and I don't want to publish something we're not using since there won't be much incentive to maintain it.

When it comes time to release this as open source, the library will have two main functions. #1 is a function to fetch feature data from the service as GeoJSON. #2 is a function which will extract style data from the service and translate it into a mapbox-gl style. It may be useful to include examples of how to load dynamic map services but [no library is really needed to do that](https://github.com/seasketch/next/blob/917bf4e2576aa07b91e6e8b1c9dc309058ebbb2c/packages/client/src/dataLayers/sourceTypes/ArcGISDynamicMapServiceSource.ts).
