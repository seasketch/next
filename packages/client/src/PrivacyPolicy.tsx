      <div className="markdown-body text-sm">
        <p className="py-2">
          The privacy of your data—and it is your data, not ours!—is a big deal
          to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how
          your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We
          promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          This policy applies to the SeaSketch software as a service at the
          University of California Santa Barbara. Each SeaSketch project
          (including surveys contained within those projects) may include a
          purpose-specific data use and sharing agreement that addresses
          handling of personal information and other submissions. In those
          cases, the project-specific agreement supersedes this one.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-bold text-xl my-2">What we collect and why</h2>
        <p className="py-2">
          Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what
          that means in practice:
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold my-2">Identity &amp; access</h3>
        <p className="py-2">
          When you sign up for SeaSketch, we ask for identifying information
          such as your name, email address, and maybe an organization name.
          That’s so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you
          SeaSketch updates and other essential information. We may also send
          you optional surveys from time to time to help us understand how you
          use our products and to make improvements. With your consent, we may
          send you our newsletter and other updates. We sometimes also give you
          the option to add a profile picture that displays in SeaSketch.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          We’ll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we
          won’t use your name or organization in marketing statements without
          your permission either.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold my-2">Product interactions</h3>
        <p className="py-2">
          We store on our servers the content that you upload or receive or
          maintain in your SeaSketch account. This is so you can use our
          products as intended, for example, to create projects in SeaSketch,
          sketch zones, or post a message in a forum. We keep this content as
          long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we’ll
          delete the content of your account within 30 days. Likewise, if you
          delete a SeaSketch project that you own, the content of that project
          will be deleted within 30 days.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold my-2">3rd Party Data Sharing</h3>
        <p className="py-2">
          We use the following service providers to provide SeaSketch
          functionality. We may share or host your data with these service
          providers and this arrangement is subject to their respective Data

        <p className="py-2">
          We collect information about your browsing activity for analytics and
          statistical purposes such as performance testing and experimenting
          with new product designs. This includes, for example, your browser and
          operating system versions, your IP address, which SeaSketch projects
          you visited, what maps you turned on and how long they took to load,
          and which website referred you to us. If you have an account and are
          signed in, these web analytics data are tied to your IP address and
          user account until your account is no longer active.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold my-2">Cookies</h3>
        <p className="py-2">
          We use persistent first-party cookies and some third-party cookies to
          store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our
          applications, and perform A/B testing as well as support some
          analytics.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help
          remember login information and site preferences. It might also collect
          information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages
          visited, duration of visit, content viewed, and other click-stream
          data. You can adjust cookie retention settings and accept or block
          individual cookies in your browser settings, although SeaSketch may
          not function properly if you turn cookies off.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold my-2">Voluntary correspondence</h3>
        <p className="py-2">
          When you email the SeaSketch Team with a question or to ask for help,
          we keep that correspondence, including your email address, so that we
          have a history of past correspondence to reference if you reach out in
          the future.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          We also store information you may volunteer, for example, responses to
          surveys. If you take a survey, you may be asked to sign a
          project-specific agreement that supersedes this one.&nbsp;

          No SeaSketch Team member looks at your content except for limited
          purposes with your express permission, for example, if an error occurs
          that stops an automated process from working and requires manual
          intervention to fix. These are rare cases, and when they happen, we
          look for root cause solutions as much as possible to avoid them
          recurring. We may also access your data if required in order to
          respond to a legal process (see “When required under applicable law”
          below).

          SeaSketch is developed and located in California and all data

            Requests for user data. Our policy is to not respond to government
            requests for user data unless we are compelled by legal process or
            in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request.
            However, if U.S. law enforcement authorities have the necessary
            warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us to share
            data, we must comply. Likewise, we will only respond to requests
            from government authorities outside the U.S. if compelled by the
            U.S. government through procedures outlined in a mutual legal
            assistance treaty or agreement. It is our policy to notify affected
            users before we share data unless we are legally prohibited from
            doing so, and except in some emergency cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preservation requests. Similarly, our policy is to comply with
            requests to preserve data only if compelled by the U.S. Federal
            Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f), or by a
            properly served U.S. subpoena for civil matters. We do not share
            preserved data unless required by law or compelled by a court order
            that we choose not to appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a
            proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required
            preservation period expires, we will destroy any preserved copies of
            customer data at the end of the preservation period.

            If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to share
            billing-related information. If that happens, we will share only the
            minimum needed, such as billing addresses and tax exemption
            information.

          Your rights with respect to your information
        </h3>
        <p className="py-2">
          We strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless
          of their location. Some of these rights include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Know.</strong> You have the right to know what
            personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline
            both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as
            how they are used, in this privacy policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right of Access.</strong> This includes your right to access
            the personal information we gather about you, and your right to
            obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and
            processing of that information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Correction.</strong> You have the right to request
            correction of your personal information.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Right to Erasure / “To Be Forgotten”. **This is your right to
            request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that
            your personal information be erased from our possession and, by
            extension, from all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some
            data deletion requests may prevent you from using SeaSketch services
            because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a
            data deletion request may result in closing your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Complain.</strong> You have the right to make a
            complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with
            the appropriate supervisory authority.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Right to Restrict Processing. **This is your right to request
            restriction of how and why your personal information is used or
            processed, including opting out of sale of personal information.
            (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Object.</strong> You have the right, in certain
            situations, to object to how or why your personal information is
            processed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Portability.</strong> You have the right to receive
            the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit
            it to another party. If you want to export data from your accounts,
            you can do so directly within the SeaSketch application.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>

              Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making.
            </strong>{" "}
            You have the right to object to and prevent any decision that could
            have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from being made
            solely based on automated processes. This right is limited if the
            decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you
            and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit
            consent.

          What happens when you delete content in your product accounts

          In many of our applications, we give you the option to trash content.
          Anything you trash in your product accounts while they are active will
          be kept in an inaccessible trash can for about 15 days.&nbsp; The
          trashed content may remain on our active servers for another 15 days
          during which content may be retrieved upon request. After a total of
          30 days, the content will be deleted from our backups forever.&nbsp;

        <p className="py-2">
          If you choose to cancel your account, your content will become
          immediately inaccessible and should be purged from our systems in full
          within 30 days. This applies both for cases when an account owner
          directly cancels and for auto-canceled accounts.
