          When we say “Regents”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are
          referring to the Regents of the University of California, a California
          public corporation, acting through its Santa Barbara campus having an
          Office of Technology &amp; Industry Alliances located at 342 Lagoon
          Road, mail Code 2055, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-2055. When we say
          “SeaSketch Team” we refer to the employees of the University of
          California Santa Barbara that develop and support the SeaSketch
          application.&nbsp;

        <p className="my-2">
          When we say “Services”, we mean any product created and maintained by
          SeaSketch developers. That includes all elements of the SeaSketch
          software as a service (SaaS), including the mapping interface, data
          hosting platform, discussion forums, survey tools, and the
          geoprocessing and reporting framework.
        </p>
        <p className="my-2">
          When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or
          organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services.

        <p className="my-2">
          We may update these Terms of Service in the future. You can track all
          changes made since 2022 on GitHub (provide link). Typically these
          changes have been to clarify some of these terms by linking to an
          expanded related policy. Whenever we make a significant change to our
          policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take
          any other appropriate steps to notify account holders.

          When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to
          the latest Terms of Service. That’s true for any of our existing and
          future products and all features that we add to our Services over
          time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right
          or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving
          that right or provision.{" "}

          If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That’s
          a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us.
          We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about who we are
          (link to lab website), and keeping an open door to your feedback (

        <ol>
          <li>
            You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and
            password. The Regents cannot and will not be liable for any loss or
            damage from your failure to comply with this security
            obligation.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            Our Services may only be used for non-profit, research and
            educational purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs
            under your account. That includes content posted by others who
            either: (a) have access to your login credentials; or (b) have their
            own logins under your account.
          </li>

            You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other
            automated methods are not permitted.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Cancellation and Termination</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse
            any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at
            any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account
            will not be able to access the account or any content in the
            account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your
            account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and
            relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the
            right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at
            any time. We have this clause because of the remote possibility of
            nefariousness. There are some things we staunchly stand against and
            this clause is how we exercise that stance.&nbsp;

          <li>
            Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we
            do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes.
            However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers.
            If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify
            you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about
            changes on our websites or the affected Services themselves.

                compelled by a US government authority with a legally binding
                order or proper request under the Stored Communications Act. If
                a non-US authority approaches the Regents for assistance, our
                default stance is to refuse unless the order has been approved
                by the US government, which compels us to comply through
                procedures outlined in an established mutual legal assistance
                treaty or agreement mechanism. If the Regents is audited by a
                tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing
                information needed to complete the audit.

          We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As

          the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any
          related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed
          and we don’t guarantee completely error-free Services.

          Services Adaptations and API Terms
        </h3>
        <p className="my-2">
          We offer Application Program Interfaces (“API”s) for some of our
          Services. Any use of the API, including through a third-party product
          that accesses the Services, is bound by the terms of this agreement
          plus the following specific terms:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any
            damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party
            products that access data via the API.
          </li>
          <li>
            Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API
            may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your
            account’s access to the API. The SeaSketch Team, in its sole
            discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. If
            we need to suspend your account’s access, we will attempt to warn
            the account owner first. If your API usage could or has caused
            downtime, we may cut off access without prior notice.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="my-2">
          Some third-party providers have created integrations between our
          Services and theirs. We are not liable or accountable for any of these
          third-party integrations.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Liability</h3>

          punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages
          for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses
          (even if the Regents has been advised of the possibility of such
          damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the
          Services; (ii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your
          transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party
          on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to this Terms of
          Service or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort
          (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory
          of liability.

          of SeaSketch; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent; and
