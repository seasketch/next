# Resilience Metrics from FRRP Coral Data
**Abstract:** The dataset includes Taxonomic richness (# of genera and species combined), intensity of bleaching, and disease prevalence, and an index of reef resilience (see VanWoesik and Burman 2012) of benthic stony corals collected from multiple habitat types across the south Florida shelf from St. Lucie Inlet to Biscayne Bay for years 2005 through 2014. The data were collected during synoptic broad-scale surveys of coral reef and hard-bottom habitats that were stratified into sub-regions or along-shelf positions (e.g., Biscayne, SEFCRI and various habitat types (e.g., patch reefs, low relief hard-bottom, high-relief spur and groove, etc.). A 200m x 200m polygon grid was used to overlay onto existing bathymetry and benthic habitat maps of the study area, and a two-stage stratified random design was used to select sites for sampling from various strata combinations of cross-shelf habitat type, along-shelf position (i.e. region), and management zone (http://frrp.org/).

**Purpose:** This dataset was compiled to 1) describe the spatial distribution patterns of stony coral density, bleaching intensity, and disease prevalence along the Florida Coral Reef Tract (FCRT) of the SEFCRI Region for the Nature Conservancy's Florida Reef Resilience Program. This dataset is intended to inform the Southeast Florida Coral Reef Initiative "Our Florida Reefs" management process.
